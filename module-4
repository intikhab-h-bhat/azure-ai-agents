🌟 What Are AI Agents?
AI agents are smart programs that act like assistants. They can understand what users say, make decisions, and do tasks on their own, like sending emails or summarizing documents. They use powerful AI models (like ChatGPT) to do this.

🧠 How Are They Different from Normal Apps?
Traditional apps follow strict rules.
AI agents, on the other hand, are more flexible—they understand language and adapt to different situations using Generative AI.

🛠️ What Tools Help Build AI Agents?
One powerful tool is:

✅ Semantic Kernel (SK)
It's an open-source toolkit.

Helps developers add AI into apps easily.

Works with different types of AI agents:

ChatCompletionAgent

OpenAIAssistantAgent

✅ AzureAIAgent (focus of this module)

☁️ What Is Azure AI Foundry Agent Service?
Think of it as a cloud platform from Microsoft where:

You can build AI agents.

You don’t need to worry about things like servers or storage.

It’s secure, reliable, and scalable.

🧩 Why Use Semantic Kernel With Azure AI Agents?
Because it:

Makes it easy to connect to Azure AI Foundry.

Helps build AI agents with very little code.

Supports plugins (small tools the agent can use to complete tasks).

Works well if you want multiple agents working together (using something called GroupChat).

📧 Real-Life Example
Imagine you want an AI agent to:

Read employees’ expense reports.

Format them.

Email them to the right people.

You can use Semantic Kernel to build such an agent. The agent can call APIs, get data, and finish the task automatically.

✅ After This Module, You Can:
Connect Semantic Kernel to Azure AI Foundry.

Build agents on Azure using Semantic Kernel.

Add plugins to make your agent smarter (like calling APIs or sending emails).
