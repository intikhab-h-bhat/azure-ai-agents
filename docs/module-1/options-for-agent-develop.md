There are several ways to create AI agents, depending on your technical skills and needs. Here’s a straightforward breakdown of the main tools and frameworks:

1. Azure AI Foundry Agent Service
What it is: A managed service on Azure to create, manage, and use AI agents.

Who should use it: Professional developers who want flexibility, more model choices, and enterprise-level security.

Best for: Building advanced agents that use Azure’s AI capabilities and can connect to custom data and services.

2. OpenAI Assistants API
What it is: An API to build AI agents using only OpenAI models.

Who should use it: Developers who want to use OpenAI models, but don’t need advanced Azure features.

Best for: Simple agents with fewer integration needs.

3. Semantic Kernel
What it is: An open-source toolkit for building and managing multiple AI agents.

Who should use it: Developers who want to create complex solutions with several agents working together.

Best for: Orchestrating multi-agent systems and handling generative AI tasks.

4. AutoGen
What it is: An open-source framework for quickly developing and experimenting with AI agents.

Who should use it: Researchers and developers who want to prototype or test new agent ideas rapidly.

Best for: Experimentation and early-stage development.

5. Microsoft 365 Agents SDK
What it is: A toolkit for building agents that can be used in Microsoft 365 and other platforms like Slack or Messenger.

Who should use it: Professional developers aiming to deploy agents across multiple communication channels.

Best for: Custom, self-hosted agents for various business apps.

6. Microsoft Copilot Studio
What it is: A low-code platform for building and deploying agents, using a visual design interface.

Who should use it: Business users or “citizen developers” with little coding experience.

Best for: Quickly creating agents that work with Microsoft 365, Teams, Slack, or Messenger.

7. Copilot Studio Agent Builder (in Microsoft 365 Copilot)
What it is: A tool for business users to create simple agents by describing what they want the agent to do.

Who should use it: Anyone needing basic automation without coding.

Best for: Everyday task automation by non-technical users.

How to Choose the Right Tool
No coding experience?
Use Copilot Studio agent builder for simple, everyday tasks.

Some technical skills, want low-code?
Use Microsoft Copilot Studio to build more advanced solutions for Microsoft 365 or other channels.

Professional developer, need advanced features?
Use Microsoft 365 Agents SDK for complex agents across channels, or Foundry Agent Service for deep Azure integration and flexibility.

Want to coordinate multiple agents?
Start with Foundry Agent Service for single agents, then use Semantic Kernel to manage and orchestrate multiple agents.

Just experimenting or researching?
Try AutoGen for rapid prototyping and idea testing.

This way, you can pick the tool that best matches your skills and the complexity of the agent you want to build.
