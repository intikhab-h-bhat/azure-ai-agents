# Introduction
Generative AI models are no longer just used for chattingâ€”they are now being built into intelligent agents that can work on their own to automate and manage complex business tasks.

In simple terms:

Generative AI agents are like smart computer programs that can understand information, make decisions, and take actions without constant human help.

These agents can analyze data, plan steps, and do tasks such as answering customer questions, organizing business processes, or even writing code.

For example, instead of a person manually checking every customer refund request, a generative AI agent can automatically check the details, verify purchases, and process refunds on its own.

These agents can adapt to new situations, learn from experience, and get better over time, making businesses more efficient and reducing costs.

Companies are using these AI agents to coordinate work between different departments, automate repetitive jobs, and make smarter decisions faster.

In short, generative AI agents act like digital workers that can handle many business tasks by themselves, freeing up people to focus on more important or creative work
