# Introduction
Generative AI models are no longer just used for chatting—they are now being built into intelligent agents that can work on their own to automate and manage complex business tasks.

In simple terms:

Generative AI agents are like smart computer programs that can understand information, make decisions, and take actions without constant human help.

These agents can analyze data, plan steps, and do tasks such as answering customer questions, organizing business processes, or even writing code.

For example, instead of a person manually checking every customer refund request, a generative AI agent can automatically check the details, verify purchases, and process refunds on its own.

These agents can adapt to new situations, learn from experience, and get better over time, making businesses more efficient and reducing costs.

Companies are using these AI agents to coordinate work between different departments, automate repetitive jobs, and make smarter decisions faster.

In short, generative AI agents act like digital workers that can handle many business tasks by themselves, freeing up people to focus on more important or creative work

# What are AI Agents?
AI agents are smart computer programs that can understand what you want, use information they know, and do tasks for you automatically.

Here’s how it works in simple words:

Imagine you have a helper at work who knows all the company’s rules about what expenses you can claim.

You can ask this helper questions, like “Can I claim my taxi fare?” The helper checks the company’s rules and gives you the correct answer.

If you have regular expenses, like a monthly phone bill, the helper can fill out and submit the claim for you, so you don’t have to do it every time.

If your claim needs approval, the helper knows who should approve it and sends it to the right person.

Sometimes, there are several helpers (AI agents) that work together:

For example, one helper can book your flight and hotel for a work trip.

This travel helper then tells the expense helper to submit a claim for your travel costs.

The expense helper processes the claim, so you get your money back.

In short: AI agents are like digital assistants that answer your questions and do tasks for you, sometimes working together to make your work easier and faster.
