# Custom Tools

Custom tools are add-ons that make your AI agent smarter and more useful. You can use them to connect your agent to other apps, services, or custom logic.

## Main options for custom tools:

### Function Calling (Custom Functions):
This lets you describe your own functions (like small programs or tasks) to the agent. When the agent gets a request, it can figure out which function to use and what information to send to it. This is helpful if you want the agent to do something specific, like run calculations or process data in a certain way.

### Azure Functions:
These are event-driven programs that run in the cloud. You can use them to do things like send notifications, process files, or connect to databases. The agent can call these functions automatically when certain events happen, making your system more flexible and automated.

### OpenAPI Specification Tools:
If you have an external API (a way for different apps to talk to each other), you can describe it using the OpenAPI standard. This makes it easy for your agent to connect to and use other web services, like checking the weather, looking up information, or interacting with other business tools.

### Azure Logic Apps:
This is a low-code way to create workflows. You can connect different apps and services together without writing much code. The agent can use these workflows to automate tasks or move data between systems.

### In short:
You can make your AI agent much more powerful by connecting it to custom functions, cloud programs, external APIs, or automated workflows. This lets your agent do more complex tasks and work smoothly with your existing tools and systems
