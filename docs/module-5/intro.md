# Orchestrate a multi-agent solution using Semantic Kernel
Learn how to use the Semantic Kernel SDK to develop your own AI agents that can collaborate for a multi-agent solution.

## Introduction

### What are AI Agents?
AI agents are smart programs that can think and act using AI. They can:
Understand instructions (like a chatbot),
Make decisions,
Complete tasks automatically.

### What is a Multi-Agent System?
Sometimes, one agent isn't enough for a big or complex task. That's when we use multiple AI agents, each with a specific job, working together like a team.

### Example: DevOps Automation Team of AI Agents
Imagine you're managing a software application. Here's how a team of AI agents can help:
Monitoring Agent – Keeps watching the system, reads logs, finds problems, and sends alerts.
Root Cause Agent – When there’s a problem, it checks what changed and finds out why it happened.
Deployment Agent – Fixes the problem automatically or undoes recent changes using deployment tools.
Reporting Agent – Writes a summary report of what happened and emails it to your team.
Each agent has a role and they talk to each other to solve the problem smoothly and quickly.


## Understand the Semantic Kernel Agent Framework

What is the Semantic Kernel Agent Framework?
It’s a toolkit for developers to build smart AI agents using Microsoft's Semantic Kernel. These agents can:

Understand what users say,

Think and make decisions,

Do tasks automatically (like answering questions, searching files, running code, or calling an API).

🧱 Key Concepts (Made Simple)
✅ Agents
Agents are smart helpers powered by AI. Each agent can:

Understand language,

Remember past conversations,

Do tasks like searching, coding, or sending messages.

🤝 Agent Collaboration
Agents can work together in a group chat. Like a team, they decide:

Who should respond,

When the conversation is complete.

⚙️ Kernel
Think of the kernel as the brain behind everything:

It manages memory, tools, and how the agent thinks or responds.

🧩 Tools and Plugins
Tools and plugins are like extra powers. For example:

Searching files,

Running code,

Calling APIs.

Agents use these to complete more advanced tasks.

🕓 History
Agents can remember past chats, which helps them give better answers in future conversations.

👤 Types of Agents (Different Roles)
Azure AI Agent
A powerful agent that can:

Chat, call tools automatically, and remember things using threads.

Use tools like file search, code running, Bing, Azure AI Search, etc.

Chat Completion Agent
Great for chatting. Understands and responds in conversations naturally.

OpenAI Assistant Agent
Smarter agent for multi-step tasks. Can do more advanced things like writing code, searching documents, and handling complex goals.

💡 Why Use This Framework?
Because it helps you:

Build smart agents that can think and act,

Make agents work together like a team,

Let humans and agents collaborate,

Automate boring or repetitive tasks,

Create goal-driven solutions (e.g., analyze data, give insights, fix issues).

🚀 In short:
The Semantic Kernel Agent Framework lets you build your own AI teammates that:

Understand you,

Work with tools,

Help each other,

And even help you do your job faster and smarter!
